This project uses the specific dataset provided at kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umerrtx/machine-failure-prediction-using-sensor-data/data

It serves for practice purposes and studying purposes only.

For the prediction, different classification models using the scikit-learn library were used like; RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, GradientBoostClassifier and SupportVectorMachine.

In the end the LinearRegression model achieved  the highest accuracy with 0.89.
The correspondig confusion matrix also shows good results by having a large amount of true positives and true negatives in relation to the false positives and false negatives, which indicates that this model can accurately predict machine failure.
